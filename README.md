Topic: Facial RecogniEon Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)  

 .	Processed and standardized facial image datasets, extracting key features by applying PCA to reduce
dimensionality while preserving variance, ensuring efficient data representation for recognition tasks.	 
	.Implemented LDA to enhance class separability, projecting the PCA-reduced data into a subspace that
maximizes differences between individualsâ€™ facial features for accurate classification.	 
	.Trained and evaluated a classifier, such as SVM or KNN, on the transformed dataset, fine-tuning	 
parameters to optimize recognition accuracy and validate performance using metrics like precision and
recall.
